# WalkieTalkieee


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Vyartha


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Fiza Fathima Puliyappilly Sudheer - Toc H Kochi 
- Member 2: Festin Biju - Toc H Kochi 

### Project Description
WalkieTalkieee is a browser-based real-time push-to-talk app that works like an actual walkie-talkie over a local network. Press a button, talk, and your voice instantly streams to everyone connected. No installation needed—just open the page, accept the mic permissions, and start chatting.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Coordinating a conversation when your phone is right next to you but you still want to feel like you're in a spy movie or a police chase.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a web walkie-talkie that lets you press and hold to talk, release to listen—just like the real thing, but with zero need for batteries, frequencies, or actual radios.
